To create a new DNS policy:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Gateway** > **Firewall policies**.
2. In the **DNS** tab, select **Add a policy**.
3. Name the policy.
4. Under **Traffic**, build a logical expression that defines the traffic you want to allow or block.
5. Choose an **Action** to take when traffic matches the logical expression. For example, we recommend adding a policy to block all [security categories](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/domain-categories/#security-categories):
   <Render
   	file="gateway/policies/block-security-categories"
   	product="cloudflare-one"
   />
6. Select **Create policy**.

For more information, refer to [DNS policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/dns-policies/).
